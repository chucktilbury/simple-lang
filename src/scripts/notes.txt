This generates a template for the actual parser and AST. If a lot of time has
been put into the parser, and this needs to be run, then a DIFF should be used
with the *.bak files to put the changes into the source code below.

When the scanner reads a token, the parser goes into the functions to find
it. It calls functions until there is either no more functions to call or until
it finds the token that was read as the first thing that is checked for. If
it's found, then the next token is read and the process repeats from where it
currently is in the call tree.

If there is an error, then the error message is placed and the function returns
NULL. The error token is discarded and the execution resumes from a point in
the call (TBD) tree such that the tokens can become synchronized again.
